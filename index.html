            <p>To My Special Best Friend,</p>
            <p>Another letter for you, maybe you’re a little annoyed by this, but I hope you’ll bear with me.
                 I’ll keep it simple this time. ✨</p>
            <p>I believe that everything in life happens for a reason. At first, I was worried about sending you 
                that long message, but now, even though I regret hurting you, a part of me feels relieved. 
                It was never my intention to hurt you, I was completely lost that day. But before I sent it,
                 I already knew that things between us might never be the same again. Still, I made the choice 
                 to be true to myself. I didn’t want to pretend. I wanted to be honest, even if it meant risking 
                 everything. And I left the decision up to you—whether to stay or walk away. But you stayed. 
                 You fought for our bond. You explained things to me. And that… means more to me than I can 
                 put into words. 💫</p>
            <p>I guess the reason I feel relieved now is that at least one person truly knows me. 
                People see me as a happy, kind girl, but I’m not perfect. I have flaws. I say the wrong things 
                when I’m angry. I can be reckless with my words. But now, I have someone who knows all 
                of that and still chooses to stay. 🙏</p>
            <p>You once said you regret ruining a friendship. But from my perspective, 
                you didn’t ruin anything. What you did was what felt right to you. You didn’t fall 
                for that girl at first sight, you developed feelings after knowing her, and that’s what makes
                it pure. I’ve always believed that a strong relationship should begin with friendship first. 
                You confessed your feelings not to destroy the friendship, but because you wanted to be honest. 
                That’s not ruining anything, that’s respecting the bond. And if people leave us, it’s not because 
                of what we’ve done, but because they didn’t want to make the effort to stay.And don't get me wrong I'm not trying to cause you any pain by reminding this, just want to make sure
                that you didn't done anything wrong. </p>
            <p>I did the same to you. I broke your trust by expecting things from you. 
                I hurt you with my words. But what did you do? You stayed. You helped me understand. 
                You told me you didn’t hate me. Thank you for assuring me that no matter how complicated 
                things get, I still have you.</p>
            <p>And about that "subscription cancellation"... I’m so sorry, bro. I never meant it the way 
                it sounded. It wasn’t because I found it annoying—it never was. I just thought it might 
                help you move forward, because sometimes, revisiting the same pain over and over makes it 
                harder to heal. But I also know that sharing your pain brings relief, and I never want you 
                to feel like you can’t talk to me.</p>
            <p>So, one last time I’m truly sorry for the things I said that hurt you. I never meant 
                them in the way they came across. And if you truly forgive me, if you still want to be 
                my special best friend forever, click the button below. 🌟</p>
